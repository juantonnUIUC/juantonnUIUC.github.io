CS416 Narrative Visualization


## Review Criteria

An essay will be required and will be submitted along with the URL of the narrative visualization. This essay is an important piece of the assignment as it is used for you to communicate your understanding of the concepts of narrative visualization and how they apply to the one you created.

The essay should contain the following sections.

1. **Messaging:** What is the message you are trying to communicate with the narrative visualization?

   This narrative visualization is intended to communicate the discrepancies in wages between the male players of the NBA and the female players of the WNBA and why those discrepancies may exist.
   In the first slide of the visualization, we see a comparision between the most elite players in both leagues based on some of the more well known in-game statistics (Rebounds, Assists, and Points).
   What we'll notice is that the NBA players show higher output for each category but show MUCH higher salaries than their WNBA counterparts. For example, Joel Embiid leads the men's league in points with an average of 33 points per game (PPG) and Breanna Stewart leads the women's league with 22 PPG; this is a 50% increase in performance output. There is a lot of nuance to consider before comparing PPG output across leagues as the NBA tends to post higher total game scores on average but it gives an idea of who the most elite players in each league are. What can be compared directly across the two graphs though is that Stewart has an annual salary of $228,094 to Embiid's $47,607,350 -  an increase of 20,771.8%! 
   The next two slides of this visualization look to compare the WNBA as a whole to other major sports leagues in the United States. In slide two, we find that the NBA post's a much higher average salary but also has a much higher revenue per player as well. What is distinct on this slide is that Major League Soccer (MLS) shows an average salary almost four times larger than that of the WNBA while having a slightly lower revenue per player than that of the WNBA!
   Similarly on slide 3 we find that the WNBA has comparable per game viewership to both the MLS and the National Hockey League (NHL), but both leagues shows much larger average salaries at an increase of 287.244% and 2,989.28% over the WNBA, respectively. 

2. **Narrative Structure:** Which structure was your narrative visualization designed to follow (martini glass, interactive slide show, or drop-down story)? How does your narrative visualization follow that structure? (All of these structures can include the opportunity to "drill-down" and explore. The difference is where that opportunity happens in the structure.)

   The 'interactive slide show' structure is used for this narrative visualization. There are three distinct slides that the user can navigate using the '1', '2', and '3, button / boxes at the top of the visualization. Within each slide, the user can interact with the visualizations using the elements in the top left corner in-addition to having the option to display tool tip annotations on mouse over for slides 2 and 3. On slide 1, the user can select a statistical game category from the drop-down menu to update the charts and display elite players for the selected category. On slides 2 and 3, the user can select to show each league on the scatter plot using the check boxes. On both slides 2 and 3, the WNBA check box is selected by default. 

3. **Visual Structure:** What visual structure is used for each scene? How does it ensure the viewer can understand the data and navigate the scene? How does it highlight to urge the viewer to focus on the important parts of the data in each scene? How does it help the viewer transition to other scenes, to understand how the data connects to the data in other scenes?

   The slide transistions are kept at the top of the visualization and are clearly labeled in order (1,2,3) to let the user know how to navigate the visualization. Each slide contains a consistent structure where a description and how-to-use guide are shown at the top half of the page and the actual data is shown in the bottom half. Each description provides an explanation for the data on that slide, including sources and the intended purpose of the slide.

4. **Scenes:** What are the scenes of your narrative visualization? How are the scenes ordered, and why?

    Scene 1 is "Elite Players' Salary Comparison across the WNBA and NBA", scene 2 is "Revenue per Player vs. Average Salary", and scene 3 is "Average Cable Viewership per Game vs. Average Salary". The scenes are ordered so that we begin with a comparison between individual players, these players are the most elite in their leagues and would be the most recognizable so it highlights the amount of money earned by a WNBA superstar compared to a superstar of the NBA. The next two scenes take a step back and look at the WNBA as a whole, rather than at individual players, and compares the WNBA to other major sports leagues. In those next two scenes, I show the MLS, NHL, NFL and MLB in addition to the NBA and WNBA because the scenes show that the wage discrepencies between the NBA and WNBA can be explained as economics because the NBA brings in much more revenue but the WNBA revenue and viewership is comparable to the MLS despite the MLS players averaging a much larger salary than the WNBA players.

5. **Annotations:** What template was followed for the annotations, and why that template? How are the annotations used to support the messaging? Do the annotations change within a single scene, and if so, how and why?

   The annotation on slide 1 is different from the annotations used on slides 2 and 3. In slide 1, I add the player's individual salary to the top of their bar graphs as an annotation. In slides 2 and 3, a trend line is added to the scatter plot in-addition to the labels attached to each point and the mouse over annotations on each point. The annotations support the message by highlighting the player's salaries and showing the trends followed across several of the United State's largest sports leagues.

6. **Parameters:** What are the parameters of the narrative visualization? What are the states of the narrative visualization? How are the parameters used to define the state and each scene?

   The paremeter on slide 1 is the value selected in the dropdown menu, the graph will update based on the value selected in that menu. The default state in slide 1 is 'Points per game' but that state changes as the dropdown menu selection is updated. In slides 2 and 3, the parameters are the checkboxes used to select which leagues the user wants to display on the scatter plots. The default state in slides 2 and 3 is 'WNBA only' but the state updates as the user selects or unselects other leagues. 

7. **Triggers:** What are the triggers that connect user actions to changes of state in the narrative visualization? What affordances are provided to the user to communicate to them what options are available to them in the narrative visualization?

   The triggers are again the elements provided in the top left corner of each slide, including the dropdown menu and the check boxes. As those menu items are updated, they trigger the visualizations to update. Additionally the buttons / boxes at the top of the page ('1', '2', '3') are used as triggers to transition to the next scene. The options available to the user are explained in the description provided on the top half of each page.
