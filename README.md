CS416 Narrative Visualization


## Review Criteria

An essay will be required and will be submitted along with the URL of the narrative visualization. This essay is an important piece of the assignment as it is used for you to communicate your understanding of the concepts of narrative visualization and how they apply to the one you created.

The essay should contain the following sections.

1. **Messaging:** What is the message you are trying to communicate with the narrative visualization?

   In this narrative visualization, the goal is to communicate the discrepancies in wages between male players in the NBA and female players in the WNBA, as well as explore possible reasons for these disparities. The first slide of the visualization compares the most elite players in both leagues based on well-known in-game statistics (Rebounds, Assists, and Points). We observe that NBA players generally show higher output for each category compared to their WNBA counterparts, but they also command significantly higher salaries. For example, Joel Embiid leads the men's league in points with an average of 33 points per game (PPG), while Breanna Stewart leads the women's league with 22 PPG, representing a 50% increase in performance output. However, Stewart's annual salary of $228,094 is substantially lower than Embiid's staggering $47,607,350, illustrating a significant wage gap between the two leagues. It's important to consider various factors, such as total game scores, when comparing PPG across leagues, but this comparison provides insight into the most elite players in each league.

2. **Narrative Structure:** Which structure was your narrative visualization designed to follow (martini glass, interactive slide show, or drop-down story)? How does your narrative visualization follow that structure? (All of these structures can include the opportunity to "drill-down" and explore. The difference is where that opportunity happens in the structure.)

   This narrative visualization follows an 'interactive slide show' structure. The visualization consists of three distinct slides that users can navigate using buttons ('1', '2', '3') at the top of the visualization. Each slide offers interactive elements that allow users to explore the data further. Slide 1 enables users to select a statistical game category from a drop-down menu to update the charts and display elite players for the selected category. On slides 2 and 3, users can select or deselect leagues using checkboxes to show specific data points on the scatter plot. The WNBA checkbox is selected by default on both slides.

3. **Visual Structure:** What visual structure is used for each scene? How does it ensure the viewer can understand the data and navigate the scene? How does it highlight to urge the viewer to focus on the important parts of the data in each scene? How does it help the viewer transition to other scenes, to understand how the data connects to the data in other scenes?

   The visual structure maintains consistency across all slides to ensure easy understanding and navigation for viewers. Each slide consists of two main sections. The top half of the page displays a description and a how-to-use guide, providing an explanation of the data presented on that slide, its sources, and its intended purpose. The bottom half of each slide contains the actual data visualizations. The visual design is carefully crafted to draw attention to crucial data points and support the narrative. For example, on Slide 1, individual player salaries are annotated at the top of their respective bar graphs. Additionally, slides 2 and 3 feature trend lines on the scatter plot, labels attached to each data point, and tooltips on mouse-over, which help viewers understand the trends and patterns across the scatter plot. The top-of-page slide transitions, clearly labeled '1', '2', and '3', indicate the sequence of the narrative and enable smooth transitions between scenes.

4. **Scenes:** What are the scenes of your narrative visualization? How are the scenes ordered, and why?

   The narrative visualization consists of three scenes:

   Scene 1: "Elite Players' Salary Comparison across the WNBA and NBA"
   Scene 2: "Revenue per Player vs. Average Salary"
   Scene 3: "Average Cable Viewership per Game vs. Average Salary"

   The scenes are ordered strategically to build the narrative effectively. Scene 1 compares individual players, focusing on the most elite players in their respective leagues. This comparison highlights the wage difference between WNBA and NBA superstars and sets the stage for further exploration. In Scenes 2 and 3, the focus shifts from individual players to the leagues as a whole, comparing the WNBA to other major sports leagues in the United States. This broader perspective allows us to analyze the wage discrepancies between the NBA and WNBA within an economic context.

5. **Annotations:** What template was followed for the annotations, and why that template? How are the annotations used to support the messaging? Do the annotations change within a single scene, and if so, how and why?

   The annotations used in the narrative visualization differ between slides. On Slide 1, player salaries are added as annotations at the top of their respective bar graphs, providing specific salary information for each player. In contrast, Slides 2 and 3 feature trend lines on the scatter plot, labels attached to each data point, and tooltips on mouse-over. These annotations complement the messaging by emphasizing key data points and visualizing trends across various sports leagues. By using different annotations, we can effectively communicate and support the narrative while adapting to the different data representations on each slide.

6. **Parameters:** What are the parameters of the narrative visualization? What are the states of the narrative visualization? How are the parameters used to define the state and each scene?

   The parameters for each slide play a crucial role in defining the narrative visualization. On Slide 1, the parameter is the value selected in the dropdown menu, which updates the graph to display the elite players for the selected statistical game category. The default state on Slide 1 is 'Points per game', but users can change the state by selecting different categories from the dropdown menu. On Slides 2 and 3, the parameters are the checkboxes that allow users to select the leagues they want to display on the scatter plot. The default state on Slides 2 and 3 is 'WNBA only', but users can update the state by selecting or deselecting other leagues.

7. **Triggers:** What are the triggers that connect user actions to changes of state in the narrative visualization? What affordances are provided to the user to communicate to them what options are available to them in the narrative visualization?

   The triggers for the narrative visualization are the interactive elements provided at the top left corner of each slide. For example, on Slide 1, the dropdown menu triggers updates in the graph when users select different statistical game categories. Similarly, on Slides 2 and 3, the checkboxes serve as triggers to display or hide specific data points on the scatter plot. Users can communicate with the visualization using these interactive elements, and the options available to them are explained in the description provided at the top half of each slide.
