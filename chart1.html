    <h2>Elite Players' Salary Comparison across the <span style="color: #e86127;">WNBA</span> and <span style="color: #113468;">NBA</span></h2>
    <p>This visualization showcases the salary differences between elite players in the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) 
        and the National Basketball Association (NBA). 
        In this interactive chart, we shed light on the financial disparities that exist between 
        female and male athletes who excel in various statistical categories.</p>

    <h3>Chart Overview:</h3>
    <p>We focus on three key statistics: "Points per game," "Assists per game," and "Rebounds per game." Users can select one of these categories from a drop-down menu, 
        and the chart will dynamically display the top 10 WNBA and NBA 
        players with the highest averages for the selected category in 
        the 2022 WNBA and 2022-2023  NBA seasons - each player's annual salary for those seasons will be displayed at the top of their bar.</p>
    <p>WNBA players are presented in the graph on the left. NBA players are presented in the graph on the right.</p>
    
    <h3>Purpose:</h3>
